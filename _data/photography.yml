mission: |
  One of the very first things I ever bought myself online was a camera. Over the years, my interest in amateur photography varied, and so did my interest in different genres. Today, I find joy in emphasising shape in my photography, floating in between of the genres of minimalism, abstract, and candid. The vast majority of the photographs shown below was taken during the first Covid shutdown in Germany in the year 2020. The lack of people around the streets made focusing on shape easy.
