      Eq. (21) in Section 2.3.3 should read:
      $$
      \sc H = (\sc U, \sc E'), \,\text"where"\, (X,Y)∈\sc E' \,\text"iff"\, ∃u∈U\\X \,\text"so that"\,X∪\{u\}=Y \,\text"and"\,u\,\text"is adjacent to"\,X
      $$

    text: Due to a transmission error, the values reported for $β_{\text factor}$ were misstated by a factor of 2. The value reported in Section 3.3 should be $β_{\text factor} = 0.66$. The values reported in Supplemental Material 8 should be $β_{\text factor} = 0.66$ for the defaults (SuperDSM) and $β_{\text factor} = 0.3$ for the U2OS dataset (SuperDSM*).

    reference: Supplemental Material 6, Eq. (S11)
    text: |
      Due to a transmission error, the threshold $σ_G$ in Eq. (S11) was misstated by a factor of 2. The correct threshold is $2σ_G$, and Eq. (S11) should thus read:
      $$
      ω↖{~}'(X) = ≤ \{ x ∈ ω↖{~}(X) | {\text dist}_{Ω_{\text fg}}(x) ≤ 2σ_G \}
      $$
